  (i)	All amounts due from you to us for the purchase of HF products, services, or otherwise exclude all transaction taxes including, but not limited to, sales, use, value added, goods and services tax, and similar taxes (“Transaction Taxes”).

To the extent that you are required by applicable law to withhold such amounts, you shall as soon as practicable provide the appropriate notification of payment of such taxes to us.
<br/>
(iii)	The parties agree to cooperate to support any reduction of or exemption from any Transaction Tax or Withholding Tax including a claim for the application of any applicable income tax convention or any exemption contained in any applicable tax laws or regulations.

These requirements are made with both your capital investment and our investments, brand reputation, and other HYDRAFACIAL® equipment owners and operators in mind.

</li>
<li><strong><u>Trade Mark Licence</u></strong><br/>11.1.	We own the intellectual property rights in our trade marks.

11.9.	You must indemnify us against all liabilities, costs, expenses, damages and losses (including legal costs (calculated on a full indemnity basis) and all other reasonable professional costs and expenses) suffered or incurred by us arising out of or in connection with any claim made against us by a third party for death or personal injury arising out of or in connection with the provision of HYDRAFACIAL® treatments or services by you, to the extent  attributable to the acts or omissions of you or your employees.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li><strong><u>Termination and consequences of termination</u></strong><br/>

(b)	you fail to pay any amount due under the Agreement on or before the due date for payment;<br/>
(c)	you suspend, threaten to suspend, cease or threaten to cease to carry on all or a substantial part of your business; or<br/>
