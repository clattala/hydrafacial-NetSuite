Hello Valued Hydrafacialist,<br />
<br />
When you purchased a Hydrafacial Syndeo machine in [Month] 2022, you were supplied with a temporary code that allowed your Syndeo to operate without interruption for the 1st full year (365 days), while taking advantage of one of our internal financing programs.<br />
<br />
Currently, your invoice [Invoice#] dated [Month-Date-Year], shows a past due balance of [$Balance] for the Syndeo device with serial number [S/N] and the temporary code will expire on [Month-Date-Year].<br />
<br />
<strong>Please contact <a href="mailto:credit@hydrafacial.com">credit@hydrafacial.com</a> to discuss your account and answer any questions you may have on the temporary code before it&#39;s expiration date to prevent an interruption to your Hydrafacial Syndeo experience.</strong><br />
<br />
We appreciate your continued support as part of the Hydrafacial Nation and look forward to growing our businesses together.
